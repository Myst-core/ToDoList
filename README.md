# ToDoList
A small To-Do List I am working on in my spare time.
## Steps
- Create a user interface with a form to add new tasks and a list to display them.
- Use JavaScript to manage adding, updating, and deleting tasks on the frontend.
- Store tasks locally in localStorage for simple persistence, or set up a backend using Node.js and Express with MongoDB for data storage.
- Optional: Implement user authentication to make it multi-user and host the frontend on Netlify and backend on Heroku.
